*Kaptain* is a universal graphical front-end tool for creating dialog-based interfaces for command-line programs, and an *API* for creating a graphical user interface for a command-line program without directly using a graphical library.

When run as a standalone front-end dialog for command-line program execution, a simple script grammar is used to describe possible arguments for the program and *Kaptain* produces a graphical dialog for the user to configure command line arguments.

*Kaptain* is a *Source Forge* project.  For further details about *Kaptain*, it's capabilities, samples, links to documentation, and source code, visit
